CHICKENS!! is a little, teeny tiny mod I made to introduce myself to modding Terraria. CHICKENS is very simple, all it does is adds 1 NPC to the game, a chicken. You can stare at the chickens all day long and watch them walk around the overworld, or brutally murder them for their meat. When killed, CHICKENS drop 'Chicken', which you can eat raw for a small health regen or cook them up for a better source of HP. Also, CHICKENS will drop 'Chicken Eggs', which you can throw at friends and enemies alike to coat them in yolky mess. Finally, if your lucky enough, CHICKENS also drop the rare "Golden Egg" which will force one of those adorable little feathery friends to follow you around all day. Have fun, and I hope you like this mod :). Open to suggestions and definately open to resprites, see mod homepage for Github Home and please message me
